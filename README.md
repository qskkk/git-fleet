```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install GitFleet** using one of the methods above
2. **Create a configuration file** at `~/.config/git-fleet/.gfconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "web-app": {
      "path": "/path/to/your/web-app"
    },
    "api-server": {
      "path": "/path/to/your/api"
    },
    "mobile-app": {
      "path": "/path/to/your/mobile"
    }
  },
  "groups": {
    "frontend": ["web-app", "mobile-app"],
    "backend": ["api-server"],
    "all": ["web-app", "api-server", "mobile-app"]
  }
}
```

3. **Run GitFleet**:

```bash
# Interactive mode - select groups and commands via UI
gf

# Or use direct commands
gf frontend pull    # Pull latest changes for frontend repos
gf backend status   # Check status of backend repos
gf all "commit -m 'Update docs'"  # Commit across all repos
```

---

## üìñ Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run `gf` without arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
gf
```

This launches a beautiful terminal UI where you can:

- ‚úÖ Select multiple repository groups
- üéØ Choose commands to execute
- üìä View execution results with rich formatting

### Command Line Mode

Execute commands directly on specific groups:

```bash
# Basic syntax
gf <group> <command>

# Examples
gf frontend pl              # Pull all frontend repositories
gf backend st            # Check status of backend repositories
gf backend fa             # Fetch all remotes for backend repositories
gf all "add . && commit -m 'fix'"  # Complex commands with quotes
```

### Global Commands

These commands work across all repositories or provide system information:

```bash
gf config    # Show current configuration
gf help      # Display help information
gf status    # Show status of all repositories
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

GitFleet uses a JSON configuration file located at `~/.config/git-fleet/.gfconfig.json`.

### Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "repo-name": {
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/repository"
    }
  },
  "groups": {
    "group-name": ["repo1", "repo2", "repo3"]
  }
}
```

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "frontend-web": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/webapp"
    },
    "frontend-mobile": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/mobile-app"
    },
    "backend-api": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/api-server"
    },
    "backend-auth": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/auth-service"
    },
    "shared-components": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/ui-components"
    },
    "documentation": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/docs"
    }
  },
  "groups": {
    "frontend": ["frontend-web", "frontend-mobile", "shared-components"],
    "backend": ["backend-api", "backend-auth"],
    "mobile": ["frontend-mobile"],
    "web": ["frontend-web", "shared-components"],
    "docs": ["documentation"],
    "all": [
      "frontend-web",
      "frontend-mobile",
      "backend-api",
      "backend-auth",
      "shared-components",
      "documentation"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Tips

- **Absolute Paths**: Always use absolute paths for repository locations
- **Logical Grouping**: Create groups that match your workflow (by team, technology, environment)
- **Overlapping Groups**: Repositories can belong to multiple groups
- **Validation**: Use `gf config` to verify your configuration

---

## üí° Examples

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start your day - check status of all projects
gf all status

# Fetch latest refs from all remotes for your repositories
gf all fetch

# Pull latest changes for your team's repositories
gf frontend pull
gf backend pull

# Work on features, then commit changes
gf frontend "add . && commit -m 'feat: new component'"

# Push all changes at once
gf all push

# Check final status
gf all status
```

### Release Management

```bash
# Check status before release
gf production status

# Create release branches
gf production "checkout -b release/v1.2.0"

# Tag release
gf production "tag -a v1.2.0 -m 'Release v1.2.0'"

# Push tags
gf production "push --tags"
```

### Team Coordination

```bash
# Fetch latest refs from all remotes to see what's new
gf all fetch

# Update all repositories to latest
gf all pull

# Check for uncommitted changes across teams
gf all status

# Run tests across all services
gf backend "npm test"
gf frontend "npm run test"
```

---

## ü§î Why GitFleet?

### Problem It Solves

Managing multiple Git repositories manually is time-consuming and error-prone:

- Switching between directories to run the same command
- Forgetting to update certain repositories
- Inconsistent workflow across different projects
- No overview of the state of multiple repositories

### GitFleet Solution

- **Centralized Management**: Control all repositories from one place
- **Consistent Workflows**: Standardize operations across projects
- **Time Savings**: Execute commands on dozens of repositories instantly
- **Better Visibility**: Clear overview of all repository states
- **Reduced Errors**: Less manual work means fewer mistakes

### Perfect For

- **Microservices Architecture**: Manage multiple service repositories
- **Multi-Project Teams**: Coordinate across different projects
- **DevOps Engineers**: Automate repository maintenance tasks
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Manage multiple project repositories
- **Development Teams**: Standardize development workflows

---

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Complex Commands

Use quotes for complex commands:

```bash
# Multiple commands with &&
gf backend "git add . && git commit -m 'fix: critical bug' && git push"

# Commands with pipes
gf all "git log --oneline | head -5"

# Environment-specific commands
gf production "git checkout main && git pull && npm install"
```

### Conditional Execution

GitFleet continues execution even if some repositories fail:

```bash
# This will attempt to pull all repositories
# If some fail (e.g., merge conflicts), others continue
gf all pull
```

### Status Filtering

```bash
# Check status of specific group
gf frontend status

# Global status (all repositories)
gf status
```
