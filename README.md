---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install GitFleet** using one of the methods above
2. **Create a configuration file** at `~/.config/git-fleet/.gfconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "web-app": {
      "path": "/path/to/your/web-app"
    },
    "api-server": {
      "path": "/path/to/your/api"
    },
    "mobile-app": {
      "path": "/path/to/your/mobile"
    }
  },
  "groups": {
    "frontend": ["web-app", "mobile-app"],
    "backend": ["api-server"],
    "all": ["web-app", "api-server", "mobile-app"]
  }
}
```

3. **Run GitFleet**:

```bash
# Interactive mode - select groups and commands via UI
gf

# Or use direct commands
gf @frontend pull    # Pull latest changes for frontend repos
gf @backend status   # Check status of backend repos
gf @all "commit -m 'Update docs'"  # Commit across all repos
```

---

## 📖 Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run `gf` without arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
gf
```

This launches a beautiful terminal UI where you can:

- ✅ Select multiple repository groups
- 🎯 Choose commands to execute
- 📊 View execution results with rich formatting

### Command Line Mode

Execute commands directly on specific groups:

```bash
# New multi-group syntax with @ prefix
gf @<group1> [@group2 ...] <command>

# Legacy single group syntax (still supported)
gf <group> <command>

# Examples
gf @frontend pull                    # Pull frontend repositories
gf @frontend @backend pull           # Pull both frontend and backend repositories
gf @api @database status             # Check status of api and database groups
gf @all "add . && commit -m 'fix'"   # Complex commands with quotes on all group
gf frontend pull                     # Legacy syntax still works
```

### Multi-Group Operations

GitFleet supports executing commands on multiple groups simultaneously using the `@` prefix:

```bash
# Execute on multiple groups
gf @frontend @backend @mobile pull    # Pull all three groups
gf @api @database status              # Check status of api and database
gf @team1 @team2 fetch                # Fetch updates for multiple teams
```

### Global Commands

These commands work across all repositories or provide system information:

```bash
gf config    # Show current configuration
gf help      # Display help information
gf status    # Show status of all repositories
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

GitFleet uses a JSON configuration file located at `~/.config/git-fleet/.gfconfig.json`.

### Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "repo-name": {
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/repository"
    }
  },
  "groups": {
    "group-name": ["repo1", "repo2", "repo3"]
  }
}
```

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "frontend-web": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/webapp"
    },
    "frontend-mobile": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/mobile-app"
    },
    "backend-api": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/api-server"
    },
    "backend-auth": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/auth-service"
    },
    "shared-components": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/ui-components"
    },
    "documentation": {
      "path": "/home/user/projects/docs"
    }
  },
  "groups": {
    "frontend": ["frontend-web", "frontend-mobile", "shared-components"],
    "backend": ["backend-api", "backend-auth"],
    "mobile": ["frontend-mobile"],
    "web": ["frontend-web", "shared-components"],
    "docs": ["documentation"],
    "all": [
      "frontend-web",
      "frontend-mobile",
      "backend-api",
      "backend-auth",
      "shared-components",
      "documentation"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Tips

- **Absolute Paths**: Always use absolute paths for repository locations
- **Logical Grouping**: Create groups that match your workflow (by team, technology, environment)
- **Overlapping Groups**: Repositories can belong to multiple groups
- **Validation**: Use `gf config` to verify your configuration

---

## 💡 Examples

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start your day - check status of all projects
gf all status

# Fetch latest refs from all remotes for your repositories
gf all fetch

# Pull latest changes for your team's repositories
gf @frontend @backend pull

# Work on features, then commit changes
gf @frontend "add . && commit -m 'feat: new component'"

# Push all changes at once
gf @all push

# Check final status
gf all status
```

### Release Management

```bash
# Check status before release
gf production status

# Create release branches
gf production "checkout -b release/v1.2.0"

# Tag release
gf production "tag -a v1.2.0 -m 'Release v1.2.0'"

# Push tags
gf production "push --tags"
```

### Team Coordination

```bash
# Fetch latest refs from all remotes to see what's new
gf all fetch

# Update all repositories to latest
gf all pull

# Check for uncommitted changes across teams
gf all status

# Run tests across all services
gf backend "npm test"
gf frontend "npm run test"
```

## 🤔 Why GitFleet?

### Problem It Solves

Managing multiple Git repositories manually is time-consuming and error-prone:

- Switching between directories to run the same command
- Forgetting to update certain repositories
- Inconsistent workflow across different projects
- No overview of the state of multiple repositories

### GitFleet Solution

- **Centralized Management**: Control all repositories from one place
- **Consistent Workflows**: Standardize operations across projects
- **Time Savings**: Execute commands on dozens of repositories instantly
- **Better Visibility**: Clear overview of all repository states
- **Reduced Errors**: Less manual work means fewer mistakes

### Perfect For

- **Microservices Architecture**: Manage multiple service repositories
- **Multi-Project Teams**: Coordinate across different projects
- **DevOps Engineers**: Automate repository maintenance tasks
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Manage multiple project repositories
- **Development Teams**: Standardize development workflows

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Complex Commands

Use quotes for complex commands:

```bash
# Multiple commands with &&
gf backend "git add . && git commit -m 'fix: critical bug' && git push"

# Commands with pipes
gf all "git log --oneline | head -5"

# Environment-specific commands
gf production "git checkout main && git pull && npm install"
```

### Conditional Execution

GitFleet continues execution even if some repositories fail:

```bash
# This will attempt to pull all repositories
# If some fail (e.g., merge conflicts), others continue
gf all pull
```

### Status Filtering

```bash
# Check status of specific group
gf frontend status

# Global status (all repositories)
gf status
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

GitFleet follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability. The codebase is organized into distinct layers with clear separation of concerns:

```
Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure
   ↑         ↑            ↑
  Pure    Use Cases   Technical
Business   Logic     Details
```

### Key Benefits

- **🧪 Testable**: Easy unit testing with mocked dependencies
- **🔄 Maintainable**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- **📈 Scalable**: Easy to add new features without breaking existing code
- **🔌 Flexible**: Swap implementations without affecting business logic

### Architecture Layers

- **Domain**: Core business logic, entities, and repository interfaces
- **Application**: Use cases, ports, and application services
- **Infrastructure**: External concerns (CLI, Git, configuration, styling)

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
